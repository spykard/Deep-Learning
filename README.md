## Guide

1. Run the .ipynb file directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Ready to go with support for easy parameter tuning.  
2. Alternatively, load the .ipynb file on a local setup featuring Jupyter Notebook and the aforementioned Dependencies.
3. In that case, small fixes are required such as removal of "!" commands, that are intended for use only with Google Colab.
4. If you want to evaluate on a single new sentence head over to the "Evaluate on External Data" section and set the `test_sentence` string.
